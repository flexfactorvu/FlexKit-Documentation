# Discount Policy
- - -

**STATEMENT**

+ I do not believe in giving frequent or steep discounts/promotions.

**RATIONALE**

+ I believe relying on discounts and promotions to make sales is a symptom of an overvalued, underutilized product. Not to mention, it can give existing customers a sense of "buyers remorse", especially if the product was purchased close to the discount period. That is not to say I am against it. But I would like to decide on my own terms, based on my own values, when and how much discount to give. I want to primarily offer you a product that you genuinely feel is *worth it* before worrying about planning special sale events or promotional periods. Once I have consulted with others more privy to risk and supply/demand calculations for the business im conducting, there is a chance I will begin offering reasonable seasonal discounts or unpredictable promotions. In the meantime however, I cannot say any discounts will ever be given.
